## 📘 About This Repository  

**100 Days of Data Science** is a personal challenge and public commitment by **Manjit Rabha** to build **100 end-to-end data science projects in 100 days**, while simultaneously documenting key self-learnings.  

This repository serves as both a **project vault** and a **learning framework** — designed for aspiring data scientists, autodidacts, and problem-solvers who want to master the full stack of data science through practice, not just theory.

## 🎯 Objectives  

- ✅ Complete 100 real-world data science projects  
- ✅ Reinforce daily learning through structured implementation  
- ✅ Share reproducible code and insights with the community  
- ✅ Build a production-ready, AI-first portfolio  
- ✅ Contribute to open learning and inspire consistent growth  

---

## 🔍 What’s Inside?  

- 📊 **Daily Projects** — from idea to deployment  
- 🧠 **Learning Notes** — short summaries, concepts, and formulas  
- 🛠️ **Code Notebooks** — Jupyter/Colab, clean and commented  
- 📁 **Datasets** — either linked or self-generated  
- 🌐 **Mini Apps** — some projects deployed via Flask/Streamlit  
- 📦 **Utilities** — reusable scripts, functions, and tools

## 🧠 Philosophical Angle  

Data is not just numbers — it's narrative.  
This challenge is about learning to **see the signal behind the noise**, to **model the abstract**, and to **build systems that matter**.
